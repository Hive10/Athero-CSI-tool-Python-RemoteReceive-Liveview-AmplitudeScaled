Hostapd will detect the environment to determine the bandwidth automatibally. Sometime we need 40Mhz for our test.

in the folder of hpstapd, open: src/ap/hw_features.c

remove the following:

if (!oper40) { // change to if (0)
        wpa_printf(MSG_INFO, "20/40 MHz operation not permitted on "
               "channel pri=%d sec=%d based on overlapping BSSes",
               iface->conf->channel,
               iface->conf->channel +
               iface->conf->secondary_channel * 4);
        iface->conf->secondary_channel = 0;
        iface->conf->ht_capab &= ~HT_CAP_INFO_SUPP_CHANNEL_WIDTH_SET;
    }

open: hostapd-2.5/hostapd/hostapd.conf

find: ht_capab=[HT20][HT40-][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40]

to: ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-40]
