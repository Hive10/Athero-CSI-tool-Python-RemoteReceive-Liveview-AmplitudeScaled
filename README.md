# Athero-CSI-tool-Python-RemoteReceive-Liveview-AmplitudeScaled

This CSI live view tools is developed based on the open source project Atheros CSI Tool (http://pdcc.ntu.edu.sg/wands/Atheros/). We add the socket function to transmit the collected data to a remote server. At the server we use python to plot the CSI at real time.

In this tool we develop the function to scale the amplitude to power in dBm.
