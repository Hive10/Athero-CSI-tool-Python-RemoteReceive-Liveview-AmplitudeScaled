This CSI live view tools is developed based on the open source project Atheros CSI Tool (http://pdcc.ntu.edu.sg/wands/Atheros/). We add the socket function to transmit the collected data to a remote server. At the server we use python to plot the CSI at real time.

In this tool we develop the function to scale the amplitude to power in dBm.

For more details, please refer the usage documents.
